<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Morse Code Decoder <a name="about-project"></a>

Morse Code Decoder is, as it name implies, a morse code decoder written in Ruby. The function (as you may have guessed) is to decode morse code and translate it into a text written in English.

This project was built from this description:

During your vacation at the seaside, time after time you find old bottles with parchment inside. Out of curiosity, you look into the next bottle and see that there is a message written in Morse code. Your curiosity grows even more - maybe you just found the lost treasure of the pirates! However, you are getting tired of decrypting messages manually. Fortunately, you can program in Ruby and you can help yourself by automating this process.

Let's not waste time, the pirate treasure awaits! Let's get to work.
